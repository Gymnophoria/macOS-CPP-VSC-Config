macOS VS Code Config -- C++
---

Heyo! This is my fairly simple to use config for Visual Studio Code, to be used with clang++. It allows for compiling multiple files at once with ease. Great for introductory CS classes.

### Installation

Go into the directory you'd like to install into and run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/nikbrandt/macOS-CPP-VSC-Config.git .vscode
```

And you're good! If you'd like to set up some keybinds like those I have, run `Cmd + K` and then `Cmd + S` and change the desired keybinds. The keybinds I have are:
 - **Tasks: Run Task** (set to `Cmd + T`) – allows for easy selection between build current file and build all files
 - **Terminal: Focus Next Terminal Group** (set to `Ctrl + Tab`) – allows for easy terminal switching
 - **Terminal: Forcus Previous Terminal Group** (set to `Ctrl + Shift + Tab`) – same as above, in reverse

### Usage

See [usage.md](./usage.md).
